# 100 Days of Code
I am starting 100 days of code now on 6 March 2023 at the advice of Kim from the Techlahoma Slack. I am also completing OKCoders bootcamp at the same time so it'll be an interesting mix of python, c++, and web development languages I'm sure.

# Day 1
I am finally getting back to a project that I was working on for a friend. I named it [pet-feeder](https://github.com/LarryL1991/pet-feeder) but it could really be used for a lot of applications. Today most of my time was honestly spent hiding sensitive details that I would normally just put into the code. For instance I now read the wallet path, public address, and private view key of my test Monero wallet rather than just store that in "feed.py" I added the variables.txt with the .gitignore file. I just recently started uploading some of my old projects to github and I learned about a lot of this stuff very recently. I deployed pet-feeder from the git command line which I think is pretty neat. As I write this I'm still waiting for my python script to read the balance of my wallet. Monero is funny because it takes a long time to read balances of an arbitrary wallet. I will continue work on pet-feeder tomorrow and hopefully make more progress than I did today.
