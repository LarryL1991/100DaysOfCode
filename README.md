# 100 Days of Code
I am starting 100 days of code now on 2023-03-06 at the advice of Kim from the Techlahoma Slack. I am also completing OKCoders bootcamp at the same time so it'll be an interesting mix of python, c++, and web development languages I'm sure.

# Day 2 (2023-03-07)
I now remember why I put the [pet-feeder](https://github.com/LarryL1991/pet-feeder) on the backburner. I had a working product (Which is seen as comments at the very bottom of the first commit), however I used a wonky loop where I called get_transfers (Monero RPC) and waited for a response. I refactored the code before putting it on the back-burner. The new code is a lot easier to read and work with and I used a better method for updating the wallet called refresh(), but the .refresh() function of the wallet class takes FOREVER to complete. There is a difference in the way get_transfers() and refresh() work (in the Monero RPC) for some reason. get_transfers() seems to get called and the python code will continue despite no response received (async), however refresh() waits for a response before continuing with the python code (synchronous). It is very strange to me because I thought that the Monero RPC would be somewhat async no matter which RPC function I called, but refresh() seems to be synchronous. I found that there's an auto_refresh option in the Monero RPC. The wallet seemingly (to me) at random would refresh from from block 1, but this process is extremely time consuming and I wanted more control of exactly when it would refresh. I added a .auto_refresh function to the wallet class so that I could disable the auto_refresh. Despite the Monero RPC doc's claims that close() would save the wallet before closing it I have found through trial and error that that is not what happens so I added .save_wallet() which I call before closing. Now the entire blockchain doesn't have to be scanned every time the wallet is opened. I've made some good progress and I'm hopeful that I'll complete this project before the end of the week.

# Day 1 (2023-03-06)
I am finally getting back to a project that I was working on for a friend. I named it [pet-feeder](https://github.com/LarryL1991/pet-feeder) but it could really be used for a lot of applications. Today most of my time was honestly spent hiding sensitive details that I would normally just put into the code. For instance I now read the wallet path, public address, and private view key of my test Monero wallet from a "variables.txt" rather than just store that in the "feed.py" file. I added the variables.txt with the .gitignore file. I just recently started uploading some of my old projects to github and I learned about a lot of this stuff very recently. I deployed pet-feeder from the git command line which I think is pretty neat. As I write this I'm still waiting for my python script to read the balance of my wallet. Monero is funny because it takes a long time to read balances of an arbitrary wallet. I will continue work on pet-feeder tomorrow and hopefully make more progress than I did today.
